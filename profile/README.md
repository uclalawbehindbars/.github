# UCLA Law Behind Bars Data Project

The UCLA Law Behind Bars Data Project builds and maintains the most comprehensive public datasets on mortality, morbidity, and health conditions inside U.S. prisons and jails. 
Our work fills a critical national data gap left by the federal government and supports researchers, policymakers, journalists, and advocates working to understand and improve conditions behind bars.

## Mission

We collect, clean, analyze, and publicly disseminate foundational data on deaths, illness, exposure conditions, and health outcomes in carceral facilities across the United States. 
These data allow for meaningful oversight, empirical research, and informed policy decision-making.

## Core Project Areas

### Prison Deaths  
Nationwide collection and standardization of all-cause prison mortality data, covering 2019–2023 with ongoing updates. **For data, click here[LINK].**

Creation of the first multi-state repository of standardized ICD-10 cause-of-death data using National Death Index records for incarcerated people.  

### Prison Rosters & Population Exposure  
Collection and cleaning of monthly population rosters.

### Environmental, Staffing, & Facility-Level Metrics  
Integration of facility-level data such as air quality, heat index, restrictive housing, staffing vacancies, and other environmental and operational factors.  

### Research & Publications  
Multiple empirical studies underway on racial disparities, life expectancy, cumulative incarceration exposure, environmental harms, restrictive housing, and jail-specific mortality dynamics.
