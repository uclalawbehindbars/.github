# UCLA Law Behind Bars Data Project

The UCLA Law Behind Bars Data Project builds and maintains the most comprehensive public datasets on mortality and health conditions inside U.S. prisons and jails. 
Our work fills a critical national data gap left by the federal government and supports researchers, policymakers, journalists, and advocates working to understand and improve conditions behind bars.

## Mission

We collect, clean, analyze, and publicly disseminate foundational data on deaths, illness, exposure conditions, and health outcomes in carceral facilities across the United States. 
These data allow for meaningful oversight, empirical research, and informed policy decision-making.

## Core Project Areas

### Prison Deaths  
Nationwide collection and standardization of all-cause prison mortality data, covering 2019–2024 with ongoing updates. **For data, click [here](https://github.com/uclalawbehindbars/deaths_in_custody)**

### Jail Deaths  
Systematic acquisition and cleaning of mortality data from local jail systems across the country.  

### ICE Detention Deaths

Collection and standardization of deaths occurring in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, using publicly released death reports, press releases, and litigation-driven disclosures. Data are analyzed separately from prison and jail deaths due to differences in legal status, detention authority, and reporting requirements.  

### Prison Morbidity  
Expansion into infectious disease, chronic illness, behavioral health, substance use disorder, emergency medical activations, and other metrics of health behind bars.  

### NDI Cause-of-Death Repository  
Creation of the first multi-state repository of standardized ICD-10 cause-of-death data using National Death Index records for incarcerated people.  

### Prison Rosters & Population  
Collection and cleaning of monthly prison population rosters.

### Environmental, Staffing, & Facility-Level Metrics  
Collection and analysis of selected facility-level metrics, including heat exposure, restrictive housing use, and staffing data, where records are available.

### Research & Publications  
Multiple empirical studies underway on racial disparities, life expectancy, cumulative incarceration exposure, environmental harms, restrictive housing, and jail-specific mortality dynamics.
